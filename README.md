# ABOUT

tf–idf, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.

This is java code for calculating tf-idf of individual words in a document in a colection/corpus.

## How to run

This code is written using netbeans. Business logic is very simple and could easily be imported to other IDEs like eclipse.

## Future Versions

Code can be extended to take document corpus directory location as an argument
